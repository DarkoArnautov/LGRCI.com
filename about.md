The Local Government Regional Center is composed of a team of investment professionals with decades of experience in both private markets and in government finance.

We are not developers seeking to find the cheapest possible source of capital. We are investors committed to using our experience to help other investors, in this case foreigners, to find the best possible vehicles in which to entrust their life savings. First, foremost, and exclusively, our mission is to ensure that every project we finance is built from the ground up to afford our EB-5 investors the greatest possible safety in terms of I-526/I-829 approval, principal payback within a 5-year timeline, and a positive Return On Investment. Our extensive roots throughout the business community of the Chicagoland area gives us privileged access to prospective developments and allows us to shape projects from the earliest possible stage to ensure that the developments we offer our EB-5 clients all in full USCIS compliance while bearing the least possible amount of risk.
